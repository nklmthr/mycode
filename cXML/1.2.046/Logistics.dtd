    Common to most variants of the PunchOut transaction set. Defined here
    to be easily shared between multiple DTD files without requiring
    inclusion of Transaction.mod in all of them.

    All of the PunchOut transaction sets include an originating Request
    (ProviderSetupRequest for example), relatively simple Response
    (PunchOutSetupResponse for example) and final Message
    (ProviderDoneMessage or PunchOutOrderMessage). The Request and
    Response comprise a back-end transaction between two cooperating
    applications that wish to extend an interactive session from one to the
    other. The Request provides the destination application with
    authentication, identification and other setup information. The
    Response provides the originating application with a unique starting
    location for the interactive (HTML) session at the destination system.

    After receiving a Response of this type, the originating application
    redirects the user's browser to the provided location. (For some
    non-HTML applications, opening a new browser window at that location
    may be more appropriate.) The destination system eventually provides
    an HTML form to the user's browser. This form submits the final
    Message to close the remote session, return that user to the
    originating application and carry any required information back to the
    originating application.

    @attr taxedElement An ID reference that uniquely identifies the item being taxed???

    @attr purpose The purpose of the tax, for example, tax (tax), custom duty, shippingTax,
       specialHandlingTax, and so on.

    @attr category The tax category, Sales tax (sales), Use tax (usage), VAT (vat),
       GST (gst) are defined categories. Other values are permitted.

    @attr percentageRate The tax rate in number of percentage.

    @attr isVatRecoverable Set to "yes" if the entire invoice is VAT (Value Added Tax)-recoverable. Default is false.

    @attr taxPointDate Refers to the date on which VAT becomes due.

    @attr paymentDate Indicates the date when payment must be made.

    @attr isTriangularTransaction Set to "true" to indicate that the transaction occurred between 
		three parties in three different countries, but the movement of goods did not follow the 
		invoicing route. Add a Contract element with role="subsequentBuyer" to identify the 
		subsequent buying organization in triangular transactions.

    @attr exemptDetail If the TaxAmount is zero, VAT or other regulations may require
		a reason why. Possible values:
		<ul>
		<li>zeroRated - The tax rate is zero.</li>
		<li>exempt - The item or items are exempt from taxation.</li>
		</ul>
	   
	@attr isWithholdingTax Set to "yes" if the tax is a withholding tax. 
	   
    @attr taxRateType Specify the tax rate type code (a string) that corresponds to a specific tax type. 
 	   For example, in Germany the tax rate of 19\% for value-added tax (VAT) corresponds to the "Standard" tax rate type. 
 	   In different EU member states, different VAT rates are allowed.
	   
 	   The tax rate type makes it easy for the back-end system to handle different rates that result from changes in tax law.

    @attr basePercentageRate The base tax rate in number of percentage. For some Tax categories (for example, ICMS for 
		Brazil) TaxAmount is calculated considering the basePercentageRate along with percentageRate.
		%
		TaxAmount = TaxableAmount * percentageRate * basePercentageRate
		$

    SupplierBatch is the batch ID provided by the supplier at the line item quantity level
    to identify  the batch in which the item or the product was produced. The batch id is helpful in traceability.

    Batch numbers (also call "lot number", "variant") are used in several industries to uniquely identify  items produced together.
-->
<!ELEMENT SupplierBatchID (#PCDATA)>


<!--
    How the supplier identifies an item they sell.

    If SupplierPartID does not provide a unique key to identify the item,
    then the supplier should generate a key which identifies the part
    uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. The
    key is called SupplierPartAuxiliaryID.


    An example is where a Supplier would use the same PartID for an
    item but have a different price for units of "EA" versus "BOX".
    In this case, the ItemIDs should be:
	%
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>EA</SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <foo>well formed XML here</foo>
        </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
	%
    In this case, the "foo" element must be defined in an internal subset
    sent with the cXML document. Otherwise, parsers will not be able to
    validate that document.

    In a preferred approach, the sending application may escape the contained
    XML using CDATA sections. This would appear as:
	%
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <![CDATA[<foo>well formed XML here</foo>]]>
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...
	%
    Finally, the angle brackets could be escaped using XML character
    entities. This might be a bit harder for humans to read. For example:
	%
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           &lt;foo&gt;well formed XML here&lt;/foo&gt;
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...
	%
-->
<!ELEMENT SupplierPartID (#PCDATA)> <!-- string -->
<!-- 
    @attr revisionID Also known as Material Revision Level. "Revision" is the most widely-used
       term for referring to that attribute which distinguishes one closely-related design 
	   iteration from another. A revision represents a change to an object, or a modification 
	   to a part such that the part remains interchangeable with its previous iteration.
       As part of engineering change management the supplier uses the revision level to uniquely 
	   identify the version of a product, of an article or of a part. 
-->     
<!ATTLIST SupplierPartID
	revisionID	%string;	#IMPLIED
>

<!--
	If SupplierPartID does not uniquely identify the item, the supplier should use SupplierPartAuxiliaryID to specify an "auxiliary" 
	key that identifies the part uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. For example, a supplier might use 
	the same SupplierPartID for an item, but have a different price for units of "EA" and "BOX". In this case, a reasonable 
	SupplierPartAuxiliaryID for the two items might be "EA" and "BOX."
	
	SupplierPartAuxiliaryID could also be used as a supplier cookie, enabling the supplier to refer to complex configuration or 
	part data. It could contain all the data necessary for the supplier to reconstruct what the item in question is in their 
	computer system (a basket or cookie of data that makes sense only to the supplier).
	
	SupplierPartAuxiliaryID can help a remote website transport complex configuration or bill-of-goods information to re-identify 
	the item when it is presented to the remote website in the future.
	
	If SupplierPartAuxiliaryID contains special characters (for example, if it contains additional XML elements not defined in the 
	cXML protocol), they must be escaped properly. Due to the necessity to pass SupplierPartAuxiliaryID information through 
	applications and back to the originating supplier, an internal subset containing any additional XML elements is insufficient.

    How the shipment will travel on this segment. Each carrier within a
    segment controlled by a third party logistics provider provides
    tracking information to that provider externally. The
    ShipNoticeRequest includes tracking information at the ShipControl
    level only.

    One Route element may describe only a single mode of travel. If
    described at all, each mode of a multi-modal route must be described by
    a separate Route element. It is not necessary to describe every leg of
    the journey to the buyer's ShipTo location.

    The only Contact roles likely to be sensible in this element are
    "carrierCorporate" (details the contact information the supplier has
    about the carrier organization), "shipFrom" and "shipTo". The
    "carrierCorporate" role would be relevant at this level only when a
    third party is providing tracking information across multiple carriers.
    A Contact element with role "shipFrom" must appear in all Route
    elements after the first. Route elements are not required to describe
    the entire travel under a specific carrier's control. They may
    describe a discontinuous stream of events, starting and ending at
    different times and locations.

    Elements in the Contact list may appear in any order. A contact role
    (Contact&#064;role attribute value) must not appear more than once within a
    Route element.

		<li>air - transportation by flight</li>
		<li>mail - This code is provided for practical reasons, despite the
			fact that mail is not a genuine mode of transport. In many
			countries, the value of merchandise exported and imported
			by mail is considerable, but the exporter or importer concerned
			would be unable to state by which mode postal items had passed

		<li>multimodal - This code is provided for practical reasons, despite
			the fact that multimodal transport is not a genuine mode of
			transport. It can be used when goods are carried by at least
			two different modes from a place at which the goods are taken
			in charge by a transport operator to a place designated for
			delivery, on the basis of one transport contract. (Operations

		referenced codes cover all aircraft that are flown, or are soon to be flown,
		for commercial scheduled or chartered services only, or have been announced
		by the manufacturer and for which airline orders have been placed.

		When the value of method is "multimodal": as this includes multiple segments,
		each of which may have different mode and means, the only possible value

    A Credential Message Authentication Code (MAC). This is used in

    (1) The MAC must prove to the receiver that it really originated
    with the trusted third party. For example, the MAC could use a shared
    secret between the receiver and the trusted third party as its
    secret key.

    (2) The MAC should be usable only by a certain sender. For example, the
    MAC could authenticate an identifier for the sending organization.

    (3) The MAC should prove that the sender is authorized to send on
    behalf of the From organization. For example, the MAC could authenticate
    an identifier for the From organization.

    (4) The MAC should limit the risk of the MAC being compromised and
    used to impersonate the sender by another party communicating with
    the receiver. For example, the MAC could authenticate an expiration date
